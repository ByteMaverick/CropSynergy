#  **Vegetable Disease Classification** 

## üìå **Problem Statement**  
Agricultural diseases significantly impact crop yields, leading to **economic losses** for farmers.  
This project aims to **develop an AI-powered application** that enables **farmers to detect diseases in potato, tomato, and apple leaves** at **early stages** using **deep learning**.  

The ultimate goal is to **build a unified model** that can classify multiple vegetable diseases and deploy it as an easy-to-use **mobile or web application**.  

The dataset is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village)**.

## üìÇ **Dataset and Preprocessing**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Loading the dataset**  
- The dataset is loaded using TensorFlow‚Äôs `image_dataset_from_directory()`, which **efficiently loads images in batches** instead of keeping the entire dataset in memory.  
- This **batch-loading mechanism optimizes RAM usage**, making the process **faster and more memory-efficient**, especially for large datasets.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Splitting the dataset**  
- The dataset is split into:  
  - **Training set (80%)**  
  - **Validation set (10%)**  
  - **Test set (10%)**  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimization for Faster Training**  
- Data is **cached, shuffled, and prefetched** to improve efficiency.  

#### üîç **Why Optimize?**  
‚úÖ **Reduces training bottlenecks** by optimizing data loading.  
‚úÖ **Increases GPU utilization** by ensuring the GPU always has data to process.  
‚úÖ **Speeds up training** by avoiding I/O delays.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Augmentation**  
- **Random flipping and rotation** are applied to prevent overfitting.

## üß† **Model Architecture**  

- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is implemented with multiple **convolutional and max-pooling layers**, followed by **fully connected layers** for classification.  
- The final output layer uses **softmax activation** for multi-class classification.  

### **Model Components:**  
‚úÖ **Convolutional layers** for feature extraction  
‚úÖ **Max-pooling layers** to reduce spatial dimensions  
‚úÖ **Fully connected layers** for classification  
‚úÖ **Softmax activation** for multi-class output

## üìä **Training and Performance**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimization Algorithms Tested**  
- **Adam** (Adaptive learning rate optimization)  
- **SGD** (Stochastic Gradient Descent)  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Loss Function Used**  
- **SparseCategoricalCrossentropy** for multi-class classification.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Preliminary Model**  
- Start with **Potato Disease Classification**  
- Dataset preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.  
- Deploy the model as a **TensorFlow Lite model for mobile/web use**.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Implement the Web Application**  
- Develop a **user-friendly interface** where farmers can upload images and get real-time disease predictions.  
- Use **Flask / FastAPI / TensorFlow.js** for model integration.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Extend to Tomato and Apple Classification**  
- Expand the dataset to include **tomato and apple leaf diseases**.  
- Train individual models for each vegetable.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Merge All Models into One**  
- Compress and unify **potato, tomato, and apple disease detection models** into a **single model**.  
- Optimize for **low-latency predictions** on mobile and web applications.
