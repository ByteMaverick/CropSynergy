# 🌿 Vegetable Disease Classification 🦠  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Agricultural diseases significantly impact crop yields, leading to economic losses for farmers.  
This project aims to **develop an application** that enables **farmers to detect diseases in potato, tomato, and apple leaves** at **early stages** using **deep learning**.

The ultimate goal is to **build a unified model** that can classify multiple vegetable diseases and deploy it as an easy-to-use **mobile or web application**.

## 📅 Project Timeline  

### 1️⃣ Create a Preliminary Model  
- **Start with Potato Disease Classification**  
  - 📂 **Dataset and Preprocessing**  
  - 🏗 **Model Architecture**  
  - 🎯 **Training and Performance Evaluation**  
  - 🚀 **Model Deployment (TensorFlow Lite model for mobile/web use)**  

---

### 2️⃣ Implement the Web Application  
- Build a **user-friendly interface** where farmers can upload images and get real-time disease predictions.  
- Use **Flask / FastAPI / TensorFlow.js** for model integration.  

---

### 3️⃣ Extend to Tomato and Apple Classification  
- Expand the dataset to include **tomato and apple leaf diseases**.  
- Train individual models for each vegetable:  
  - 📂 **Dataset and Preprocessing**  
  - 🏗 **Model Architecture**  
  - 🎯 **Training and Performance Evaluation**  
  - 🚀 **Model Deployment (TensorFlow Lite model)**  

---

### 4️⃣ Merge All Models into One  
- Compress and unify **potato, tomato, and apple disease detection models** into a **single model**.  
- Optimize for **low-latency predictions** on mobile and web applications.  

---

### 5️⃣ Final Project Deployment  
- Deploy the **web and mobile application** with the trained model.  
- Ensure a smooth **user experience** with fast and accurate predictions.
